# Answer Engine Optimization Tools

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the emerging discipline focused on improving how products, apps, and brands are recommended by AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, and Gemini.  
Instead of optimizing for traditional search engines, AEO tools measure and influence visibility in **AI-generated answers**, tracking prompts, citations, and competitor mentions.

This repository provides an overview of the leading tools in this space.
